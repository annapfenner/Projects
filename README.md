### Project List

1. Project 1: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews
   - Description: This project involves sentiment analysis using logistic regression on a dataset containing 4 million Amazon reviews. The goal is to predict whether a review is positive or negative based on its text content.
   - Techniques Used: Logistic regression, text preprocessing, CountVectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer.
   - Results: Achieved a precision score of 0.8856 using CountVectorizer and 0.8830 using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
   - Next Steps: Explore other models such as Random Forest and LSTM neural networks.

2. Project 2: Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms
   - Description: This project aims to segment customers based on various demographic and spending attributes, including age, education, income, and purchase behavior. Clustering algorithms such as K-means and DBSCAN are employed to identify distinct customer groups.
   - Techniques Used: Feature engineering, StandardScalar, PCA, clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN), evaluation metrics (Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index).
   - Results: Achieved optimal clustering with K-means, yielding a Silhouette Score of 0.3614 and a Calinski-Harabasz Index of 2845.15. DBSCAN, while attempted, showed suboptimal performance with a Silhouette Score of 0.2538 and a Calinski-Harabasz Index of 30.21.
   - Next Steps: Further refine clustering algorithms and explore additional features for segmentation.


### Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own jupyter notebook within the repository. Inside each notebook will contain the data used for the project and a brief overview.
