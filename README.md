### Project List

1. Project 1: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews
   - Description: This project involves sentiment analysis using logistic regression on a dataset containing 4 million Amazon reviews. The goal is to predict whether a review is positive or negative based on its text content.
   - Techniques Used: Logistic regression, text preprocessing, CountVectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer.
   - Results: Achieved a precision score of 0.8856 using CountVectorizer and 0.8830 using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
   - Next Steps: Explore other models such as Random Forest and LSTM neural networks.


### Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own jupyter notebook within the repository. Inside each notebook will contain the data used for the project and a brief overview.
